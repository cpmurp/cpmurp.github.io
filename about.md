This is the online thoughtdumpster of Colin Murphy.

I am a senior at Tufts University, where I study Computer Science and German Studies. During Spring of 2019, I studied at Humboldt Universit√§t Berlin, where I pursued coursework in Media Studies and Cultural Studies.

My primary interests are:

	Cybersecurity
	Data Privacy
	Media Theories
	Media Platforms and Capitalism
	Attention Economies

I'll be posting a selection of my own writings as well as interesting readings within (and occaisionally outside of) these subject areas.
