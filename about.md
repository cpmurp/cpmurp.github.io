I am a senior at Tufts University, where I will major in computer science and german studies. During Spring of 2019, I studied at Humboldt Universit√§t Berlin, where I pursued coursework in media studies and cultural studies. My primary interests are cybersecurity, data privacy, media theories, and queer studies.
