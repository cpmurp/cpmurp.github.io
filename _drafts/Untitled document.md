**Introduction by Leif Weatherby**

*Differentiation of "Technik" and “Technology” *

This was an interesting nugget of information which I hadn’t encountered before. I’ve blindly associated the term "technology" with products (mechanical, electrical, computational) – it seems this interpretation is loaded. Technology derives from the Greek words *techne* and *logos*. *Techne* refers not to hammers, nails, and quantum computers; instead it defines a metaphysics of those things.

Specifically, *techne* found meaning in the cognitive methods of production, the products realized through those methods, as well as the cultural, collective knowledge of these modes of creation. Later, the German word *technik* would find its way into the post-techne lexicon. This word is more easily understood in the context of *techne* than that of *technology*. 

Weatherby feels that this word, Technik, is a convenient encapsulation of Kapp’s vision of Technology itself. 

"Kapp’s humanism emerges as a posthumanism because technologies provide the epistemological precondition for the concept fof the human by demonstrating the inseparability of *use* and *being*, or one could also say, *information* and *matter*. His understanding of technology preserves the full force of the German term *Technik*, which has found imperfect translation as “technics," “techniques,” and “technology,” suggesting that the essence of technologies is in how they work.”

I found Weatherby’s dissection of the word instrumental in my understanding what this book is about and why it matters. The cultural mechanics of technology are necessarily indiscernible from the products it creates in a comprehensive analysis of its entirety.
