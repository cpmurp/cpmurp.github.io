**Rene Pollesch, Tech Trends, and Cybernetics** 
In 2001, Rene Pollesch produced www-slums, an experimental play set in a post-internet dystopia. For shelter, Pollesch’s characters find refuge beneath laptops, worn as hats, and within IoT refrigerators. 
Pollesch carefully and correctly pred:icted several trends in this work, namely, the preeminence of Amazon; the demise of Barnes and Noble; near-automated shopping experiences, in which desire is captured in its path to consumption … more broadly, he noted the proliferation of capitalism through platforms on the internet, and a mystification of production that occurs digitally.
Implicit in his observations is a cybernetic mechanics elucidated in Ernst Kapp’s 1877 Elements of a Philosophy of Technology. Kapp’s work details the nature of technology as a projection of human organs, through which we can understand more deeply the “vorbild”, or prototypal image of projection. 
In www-slums, the internet serves as the “nachbild,” or after-image, of capitalism. The motivations and desires of capitalism have been projected into a virtual sphere, and only in this mystifyingly surreal space do the characters question its mechanics. In certain moments, Catrin questions her place (or lack thereof) within this virtual dystopia, in which “production” is entirely obfuscated. (“Hier macht man nicht! Produziert man nichts oder so was!”) She wonders whether her function within the pre-slum world was any more valuable, but can’t exactly define why her existence there was intrinsically valuable either, despite her ability to materially produce in that world.
