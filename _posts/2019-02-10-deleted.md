As of three days ago, I did a hard delete of all of my social media accounts. Instagram is permanently deleted, and I must wait 30 days before my Facebook account completely dissappears. (I find this frustrating).

In the mean time, I've had more time to socialize and used less time to refresh my phone, though have turned surprisingly to email. To be edited tomorrow.
