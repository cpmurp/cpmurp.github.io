Pete Buttigieg Chose to be Gay

Barack Obama was our first black president. A number of black critics, ranging from Ben Carson to Cornel West, believed that President Obama wasn’t black enough – he came from a wealthy family and spent the majority of his early life bouncing between elite universities and successful private firms — and thus didn’t have many of the experiences attached to the political identity of blackness he wielded. 

He was, regardless of what experiences he had in his life, black. When you see Obama, you know he is black. It‘s how he is legible to others in a country where race is steeped in meaning and prejudice. It was, then, unavoidable that his blackness be reflected in his campaign. Barack Obama would be America’s first black president whether he liked it or not. Barack Obama did not choose to be Black. 

Pete Buttigieg chose to be gay. I did, too. Gay desires cannot be chosen; we don’t have much of a say in our sexual desire. We do, however, choose and refine our public image.  Choices, unlike identities, can be criticized. 

I didn’t choose to want in the way I do, but I did choose, in many ways, to be the way I am. Gay desire and being gay are distinct – unless  “being” gay pertains exclusively to sexual desire, I choose to be gay daily. I speak with gay mannerisms, something, that although natural to me now, was not when I first came out at 15; I rave fervently and openly about bottoming; I bleach my hair seasonally; I complain loudly about the tribulations of douching; I refer to inanimate objects with gendered pronouns; I drink iced coffee in 28 degree Medford weather. In short, I’m pretty faggy.

David Halpern, a gay scholar who wrote a 500-page book on the process of gay acculturation (How to be Gay) would agree with me when I say that having anal sex with other men is among the least gay things I do on a regular basis. In fact, for me, it seems among the straightest: sex is one of the spheres of my life where I behave most masculine; that’s how I have learned to desire sexually – a choice I don’t actively make. According to Halperin, “Gayness is not a state or condition. It’s a mode of perception, an attitude, an ethos: in short, it is a practice.”

If I spent a few less nights on Grindr every month and consulted a voice coach, I could work to pass as straight. I imagine that would be a fairly pleasureless life – something many manage to attain without any structural forces working against them at all. 

Say I followed through with this and became straight: you might suggest that my commitment to straightness, alongside my evident commitment to being miserable, would be a result of some deeply illogical concoction of internalized homophobia. I would be hesitant to agree. Perhaps there is something I want more than anything else, and to get it, I believe that I must repress my desire. That seems pretty logical.

In the first breath of Pete Buttigieg’s interview with The Daily, he admits that as early as the 6th grade, he wanted to be president. He then remarks, “but, in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed to be a choice: you could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person. Not both.” I don’t disagree with Pete here. Only as recently as 1970 have we had openly gay politicians in the United States, and Indiana elected its first openly gay representative at the local level in 2018. 

Pete Buttigieg did not come out until the age of 33, in 2015. By that point, he’d spent four years at Harvard, one at Oxford, three at McKinsey and Company, several with the US Navy, and most recently, several years as Mayor of his hometown, South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg’s seemingly perfect résumé as a presidential hopeful has drawn as much ire as it has praise. There’s something grotesquely perfect about it; it realizes the dream of a 6th grader with presidential aspirations. 

This is discussed in his interview with The Daily, in which Buttigieg suggests a hypothetical example of a mid-career politician being sworn into office as an assistant secretary to the Middle East. “Imagine if that person got there in one of two ways – in universe A, it’s the person who woke up in high school one day … and did everything in order to occupy that title. The other person is someone who woke up in high school, and said I want the United States to be a force towards peace.” 

He concludes that the latter would be a better fit for the role. His example draws a distinction between politicians who want to be something, and those who want to do something. Buttigieg would like us to believe that he’s among the doers. 

The question, then, is what exactly does he want to do? In the beginning of his interview with The Daily, Buttigieg describes an initial frustration with politics he felt during his freshman year at Harvard in 2000, which galvanized his interest in career politics. “You had this kindof center right, and center left, both of them very committed to growth and business – but it seemed not very committed at all to … how we take care of vulnerable people around the country.” 

There are many ways to serve vulnerable people in the United States, but neither McKinsey and Company nor the US Navy rank particularly high on that list. If this is the ambition he claims as a politician, his résumé does not back it up – and nor does his track record as Mayor of South Bend, where he’s notoriously unpopular with black and low-income communities. 

When Pete Buttigieg attempted to endear himself to minority voters he hopes to court, spoke of his experience as a gay man during the most recent democratic debate. “I care about this because while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country,” He rightfully acknowledges that the prejudices against these identities appear in vastly different ways.

Key differences between racism and homophobia are well observed by Oliver Davis, a black council member in South Bend, IN, where Buttigieg is standing Mayor.  “When you see me, you would know that I’m African American from day one. When someone is gay or a lesbian, unless they tell or they are seen in certain situations, then no one is going to know that. They are able to build their résumés and build their career.”

Her analysis isn’t perfect – many of us can hardly speak or walk without exposing our queerness—but I think Davis’ thoughts extend particularly well to Buttigieg. Without his husband, a now central fixture on his campaign with a cult following of middle-aged white women, or his coming out editorial in 2015, we’d never know that he is gay. For many other queer people, we are out of the closet long before we decide to be, simply because we are read as such. 

Buttigieg reaped the benefits of straightness until he was 33, at which point, he chose to be gay. He has chosen to be gay in particular ways. He proudly pronounced that he and Chasten did not meet on “that app” (referring to Grindr, a gay sex app which displays users by geolocation) and has also said that he doesn’t consume “gay media”.  He posed, blindly, for a thirst trap photo in front of Berlin’s Holocaust memorial, posted to his husband’s Instagram with the caption, “this guy.” 

It’s clear that Mayor Pete is that kind of gay – the white, unaware, careerist dog-dad who views gay rights as a result of “coalition of people like me and people not at all like me … making it possible for me to be standing here wearing this wedding ring”, while simultaneously denying the central role of activists in achieving social and political progress. Buttigieg doesn’t see himself as a member of the acculturated gay troops described by David Halperin in How to be Gay. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that, although the claim that he is a “bad gay” isn’t a new one; if I were to pen such an op-ed, I would join thousands of lines of gay internet vitriol.

While I don’t fundamentally take issue with the assimilationist gay lifestyle, I do take issue with Buttigieg’s claim to gayness as a political identity. For candidates in the Democratic Party, which has prided itself on wrangling minority votes since it fled from class issues after FDR, having a marginalized identity to speak from is undoubtedly beneficial for connecting to voters of other marginalized groups.

Buttigieg claims that he has been surprised by the response to his coming out, which he announced only months before his reelection in South Bend in 2015. He won with 80 percent of the vote. I do not believe that he is surprised. I believe this aspect of his candidate profile would actually benefit him on the national stage. Buttigieg is a politician who focus-groups his politics aggressively; on twitter, it’s even been reported that he focus-grouped the pronunciation of his last name. 

If Buttigieg waited until it was politically safe to come out, his claim to gayness as a political identity – a tool for connecting to other marginalized groups – is completely invalid. For Buttigieg, coming out was a decision; another step in his road to the presidency – and should be met the same skepticism facing the other lines of his résumé. 

For those of us who have practiced being gay, it is frustrating to see a candidate exploit this identity for political gain. The only repercussion of marginalization Buttigieg has faced was self-imposed: he believed that he must repress his sexual desire in order to be something. He did that until it became safe to be a gay career politician. 

I don’t want to hear Buttigieg speak on sticking up for vulnerable communities when he himself has never been vulnerable. His policies are centrist; he won’t even take risks in his political stances – despite praising Bernie Sanders’ courage in an award-winning essay he wrote in 2000. He is invested in electability, not action. There is nothing courageous about Buttigieg, and certainly nothing progressive about him. 

Pete would not be our first gay president. There have been many before him. He would be the first president who chose to be gay in the interest of power.
